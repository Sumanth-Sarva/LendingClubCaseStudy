# LendingClubCaseStudy
> Consumer finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.
> Types of risks are associated:
  - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
  - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
 We need to calculate risk for each applicant and process accordingly in order to obtain profits and minimizing losses.
